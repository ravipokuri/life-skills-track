# What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?
* Give the speaker your full attention. Make eye contact, face the person, and avoid distractions like checking your phone or looking around while they are speaking. Show that you are interested in what they have to say.
* Use nonverbal cues to demonstrate your engagement. Nod your head, smile, and use facial expressions to show that you are actively listening and interested in the conversation.
* Repeat what the speaker said in your own words. This demonstrates that you understood the message and allows the speaker to clarify any misunderstandings. It also shows that you are genuinely trying to comprehend their perspective.
* If something is unclear or you need more information, ask questions for clarification. This helps you gain a better understanding of the topic and shows that you are invested in the conversation.
* Allow the speaker to finish their thoughts before responding. Interrupting can be disruptive and make the speaker feel unheard. Wait for natural pauses to ask questions or provide input.
* Try to put yourself in the speaker's shoes and understand their feelings and emotions. Respond in a way that shows empathy and understanding. Avoid judgment and criticism, as it can hinder effective communication.
